// Chris' paper (pg 19 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.906545v1.full.pdf)

// Chris was more thoughtful about frequency/amplitude/phase, AFAIK
// Frequency was chosen so that harmonics wouldn't overlap
// amplitude were proportional to 1/f so each individual sinusoid had similar peak velocity
// random phases to allow same freqs&amps without learning specific sequence

// Maurice & co (pg 14 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-0600-3.pdf)
// frequency was 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (1 = 768 trials (entire exp), 16 = 48 trials)
// amplitude was fixed 10deg
// unclear if phase was fixed or what
